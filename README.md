# Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL) Learning Path

Welcome to the **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL) Learning Path** repository! This repository serves as a structured collection of notes, examples, and exercises designed to guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Transact-SQL (T-SQL).

Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps into SQL Server or an experienced professional looking to refresh your knowledge, this resource aims to provide clear, concise, and practical insights into T-SQL programming.

## 🚀 Module Objective

The primary objective of this learning path is to provide a comprehensive and practical guide to T-SQL, enabling learners to:

* **Understand Core Concepts:** Grasp the foundational building blocks of SQL Server, including data types, operators, and control flow.
* **Master Data Manipulation:** Learn to effectively query, insert, update, and delete data using DML statements.
* **Design and Manage Databases:** Gain proficiency in DDL statements for creating and altering database objects.
* **Develop Advanced Querying Skills:** Explore complex topics like functions, stored procedures, views, joins, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
* **Optimize Performance:** Understand indexing and query optimization techniques to write efficient T-SQL code.
* **Perform Database Maintenance:** Learn essential DBCC commands for maintaining SQL Server databases.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

1.  **Write robust T-SQL queries** for data retrieval, manipulation, and definition.
2.  **Design and implement efficient database objects** (tables, views, procedures, functions).
3.  **Troubleshoot and optimize SQL queries** for improved performance.
4.  **Understand best practices** for T-SQL development and database maintenance.
5.  **Confidently work with Microsoft SQL Server** in various development and administrative roles.
